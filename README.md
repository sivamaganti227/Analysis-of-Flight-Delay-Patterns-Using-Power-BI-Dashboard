Hello Everyone 👋 
Im excited to share my latest power BI project:
"Airline Delay Cause Analysis" 

Project Overview :
This project focuses on analyzing airline flight delays using Power BI to understand why delays happen and how they vary across airlines and airports. The goal was to transform raw flight delay data into a meaningful dashboard that provides quick insights into delay causes, frequency, and trends.
The dataset was cleaned and prepared using Power Query to handle duplicates, missing values, and formatting issues. Key metrics such as total delayed flights, average delay time, and delay causes were calculated using DAX. Interactive visuals were then built to allow users to filter data by airline, airport, and delay type.
The final dashboard helps identify the most common reasons for delays, compare airline performance, and support better operational and planning decisions. This project showcases hands-on experience with data cleaning, modeling, and visualization in Power BI.# Analysis-of-Flight-Delay-Patterns-Using-Power-BI-Dashboard
